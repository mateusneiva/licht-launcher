# Licht Launcher

An unofficial Minecraft: Java Edition launcher targeting Windows and Linux,
built with Tauri v2, React, TypeScript, and Rust.

**Unofficial project, not affiliated with Mojang Studios or Microsoft.**

## Project status

Milestone 1 is done from the command line. `licht` can list Mojang's manifest,
install a version, and launch it with an offline name. The desktop window is
still the foundation shell: it does not install or launch. Phase 5, the
interface, has not started. Its command contract has to be approved first.
See the [roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md).

What a launch does today:

- Game files come from Mojang and stay in Licht's data directory, not in the
  official `.minecraft` folder. The default Java is Eclipse Temurin. `--java`
  uses another executable. A Java already on the machine is not picked by itself.
- Each version gets `instances/<id>` next to the data directory. LaunchWrapper
  versions (through 1.5.2) keep the game in `instances/<id>/.minecraft`.
- Natives are extracted once per version into `natives/<id>`.
- Versions through 1.7.2 get their sounds copied to the names those clients
  open. Newer versions read the hashed asset objects directly.
- The game log is read as UTF-8 on Java 18 and newer, and as the system code
  page on older Java. A bad byte does not kill the process.

Still open: `${auth_session}` is not filled, and there is no Microsoft login
(phase 7). The live checks so far were on Windows.

```sh
cargo run -p licht-core --bin licht -- versions
cargo run -p licht-core --bin licht -- install --version 1.20.1
cargo run -p licht-core --bin licht -- launch --version 1.20.1 --username Player
```

`launch` does not download. `install` does. `--game-dir` replaces the instance
root. `--cache` replaces the data directory. `--java` skips Temurin.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 24, version 24.15.0 or newer within that major version.
- pnpm 10.33.0, as specified in `package.json`.
- Rust installed through rustup, with `cargo`, `rustc`, and `rustup` on PATH.
  The repository selects Rust 1.99.0, rustfmt, and Clippy through
  `rust-toolchain.toml`.
- [Tauri v2 system prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/):
  C++ build tools, Windows SDK, and WebView2 on Windows; the required development
  libraries, including WebKitGTK 4.1, on Linux.

## Development

From the repository root:

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm tauri dev
```

The frontend development server is started automatically by the Tauri command.

To build the release executable without an installer:

```sh
pnpm tauri build --ci --no-bundle -- --locked
```

## Quality checks

```sh
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --locked
```

The same checks and the Tauri release build run in GitHub Actions on Windows and
Ubuntu. `pnpm lint` checks formatting and imports as well as lint rules.
