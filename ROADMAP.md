# ROADMAP: Licht Launcher

Unofficial Minecraft: Java Edition launcher for **Windows and Linux**, built with Tauri v2 (Rust + TypeScript).

**Frontend stack:** React + TypeScript + Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui (Radix UI), Lucide (icons), TanStack Router (file-based routes, hash history), Vitest + Testing Library (tests). Planned, not installed yet: TanStack Query (calls to Rust), Zustand (global state), TanStack Virtual (large lists).

> **How to use:** always ask for **one item at a time** ("do item 3.2"). Flow for each item: **plan → approval → implementation → PR → review**. Follow `CLAUDE.md`.

Legend: `[ ]` pending · `[x]` done · 🛑 = decision that requires explicit approval before coding · 📚 = Rust concepts that show up

## Identity and conventions

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Display name | **Licht Launcher** (*Licht* = "light" in German; adopted pronunciation: "líkt") |
| Repository / packages | `licht-launcher` |
| Binary / command | `licht` |
| Core crate | `licht-core` |
| Symbol (logo) | a lily made of light |
| Required notice | "Unofficial project, not affiliated with Mojang Studios or Microsoft" |

> 🛑 Before item 0.1: confirm the domain (e.g. `licht.app`, `getlicht.com`, or a `.com.br` at registro.br) and the app *bundle identifier* (e.g. `app.licht.launcher`).

### Version codenames

Each `0.x` release gets the name of a flower, in German, in this order:

| Version | Codename | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 0.1 | **Lilie** | lily |
| 0.2 | **Iris** | iris |
| 0.3 | **Rose** | rose |
| 0.4 | **Immergrün** | periwinkle |
| 0.5 | **Anemone** | anemone |
| 0.6 | **Narzisse** | daffodil |
| 0.7 | **Edelweiß** | edelweiss |

The codename appears on the About screen, in the GitHub release title, and in the installer name (e.g. `Licht-Launcher-0.1.0-Lilie`). From 0.8 on, the list continues (🛑 define together).

## Phase 0. Foundation — closed

**Goal:** repository ready, with automated quality from the first commit.

- [x] **0.1** Create the workspace: `crates/licht-core` (lib), `src-tauri` (app), `src/` (TS + Vite frontend).
  - 🛑 Package manager (pnpm) and frontend folder structure (`src/routes`, `src/components/ui`, `src/features/*`, `src/lib`).
  - 📚 Cargo workspace, lib vs bin crates.
- [x] **0.2** Tooling: `rustfmt`, `clippy -D warnings`, Biome (lint and formatting), strict TypeScript, Vitest + Testing Library.
- [x] **0.3** CI (GitHub Actions) with a **windows-latest + ubuntu-latest** matrix: fmt, clippy, Rust and frontend tests, Tauri build.
- [x] **0.4** Logging structure (`tracing`) and base error type (`thiserror`) in the core.
  - 📚 `Result`, the `?` operator, `thiserror` vs `anyhow`.
- [x] **0.5** Short `ARCHITECTURE.md` describing the layers (core / tauri / frontend).
- [x] **0.6** Project license and "unofficial" notice in the README.
  - 🛑 License (MIT, Apache-2.0, GPL...).
- [x] **0.7** **Base design system**: Tailwind + shadcn/ui configured, **design tokens** (colors, radii, spacing, typography) as CSS variables in a single file, light/dark theme, Lucide icons, and base components (Button, Input, Dialog, Tabs, Progress, Toast, Select, Tooltip, ScrollArea). Page `/#/styleguide`, visible only with `VITE_SHOW_STYLEGUIDE=true`, showing all of them.
  - 🛑 **Tailwind version (v3 or v4):** test on an older WebKitGTK (e.g. Ubuntu 22.04) before deciding. If there is a problem, use v3.
  - 🛑 Visual direction: palette, typography, light/dark, level of minimalism (starting point: lily of light, soft tones).
  - Avoid heavy effects (`backdrop-filter`, blurs, and large shadows) because of WebKitGTK on Linux.

**Closed.** The main window opens empty, CI covers Windows and Ubuntu, and the style guide is at `/#/styleguide` when `VITE_SHOW_STYLEGUIDE=true`.

**Context beyond the items:** TanStack Router was installed in this phase (`@tanstack/react-router` and the Vite plugin). Routes are files in `src/routes`; screens stay in `src/features`. The tree generated in `src/routeTree.gen.ts` is committed, so `tsc` does not depend on a Vite build. History is hash-based (`/#/` and `/#/styleguide`) because the Tauri window does not rewrite paths to `index.html`. The guide no longer depends on `import.meta.env.DEV`: the route responds not found unless `VITE_SHOW_STYLEGUIDE=true` (template in `.env.example`). TanStack Query, Zustand, and TanStack Virtual remain decided and not installed. Interface text is in English.

## Phase 1. Mojang data (parsing)

**Goal:** read and understand the manifests, with no network in tests.

- [x] **1.1** `serde` types for `version_manifest_v2` + HTTP client (`reqwest`) to fetch it.
  - Fixture: save a real manifest in `tests/fixtures`.
  - 📚 `serde`, `struct`/`enum`, `async/await` with `tokio`.
- [x] **1.2** Types for a **version JSON** (libraries, arguments, assetIndex, mainClass, downloads, javaVersion). Test with fixtures of old versions (e.g. 1.8, 1.12) and new ones (1.20+, 1.21).
  - 🛑 Strategy for versions with the old format (`minecraftArguments`) vs the new one (`arguments`).
- [x] **1.3** **`rules`** evaluator (os/arch/features) with tests covering Windows, Linux, and different architectures.
  - 📚 `match`, `Option`, simple traits.
- [x] **1.4** Types and reading of the **asset index**.

**Done when:** a test loads the JSON of any fixture version and lists the libraries that apply to the current OS.

---

## Phase 2. Downloads

**Goal:** download everything in a way that is fast, verified, and resumable.

- [x] **2.1** Single-file downloader: stream to disk, **SHA1 verification**, atomic write (`.part` → rename), retry with backoff.
  - 📚 Buffer ownership, `Path`/`PathBuf`, `AsyncRead`.
- [x] **2.2** Parallel queue with a concurrency limit (e.g. 8-16) and progress aggregation.
  - 🛑 Default concurrency limit and retry policy.
  - 📚 `tokio::spawn`, `Semaphore`, channels (`mpsc`).
- [x] **2.3** Directory structure and **shared cache** (libraries, assets by hash) outside instances.
  - 🛑 On-disk layout (compatible or not with the official `.minecraft`).
  - Use `directories` for per-OS paths.
- [x] **2.4** Version installer: given a version ID, downloads client.jar + libraries + assets and skips what is already valid.

**Done when:** installing the same version twice downloads everything the first time and nothing the second time.

---

## Phase 3. Java

**Goal:** have the right Java for each game version, without the user installing anything.

- [x] **3.1** Discover the required runtime (`javaVersion` from the version JSON).
- [x] **3.2** Download and install the Mojang runtime (`java-runtime` manifest) or Adoptium/Temurin.
  - 🛑 Which source to use by default and whether the user can point to their own Java.
- [x] **3.3** Detect already installed Javas (optional) and validate the version.

**Done when:** asking for "1.21" and "1.8" results in two distinct, correct, usable runtimes.

---

## Phase 4. Game assembly and execution

**Goal:** open Minecraft.

- [x] **4.1** Extraction of **natives** per platform into a temporary folder per run.
  - 📚 `zip`, I/O error handling.
- [ ] **4.2** **Classpath** assembly (`;` separator on Windows, `:` on Linux) and the full command: JVM arguments + game arguments, with variable substitution (`${auth_player_name}`, `${game_directory}`, `${assets_root}`...).
- [ ] **4.3** Process execution (`std::process`/`tokio::process`), stdout/stderr capture, end/crash detection.
- [ ] **4.4** Test CLI (`licht`) in `licht-core` (example/binary) with **offline auth for development only**.
  - 🛑 Whether offline mode stays restricted to dev builds or becomes a feature (implies legal/product decisions).

### 🏁 Milestone 1: the game opens

Install and open **vanilla 1.21.x** and **an old version (1.8.9)** on Windows and Linux, from the CLI.

---

## Phase 5. Basic interface

**Goal:** use all of this through a UI.

- [ ] **5.1** Tauri commands (`list_versions`, `install_version`, `launch`), thin, only calling the core. Types shared with the frontend via `ts-rs`/`specta`.
  - 🛑 Contract (names and types) of commands and events.
  - 📚 `#[tauri::command]`, `State`, `Arc`/`Mutex`.
- [ ] **5.2** Progress events (download, installation, game status) emitted from Rust to the frontend, with **throttling** (~100 ms) so the UI is not saturated.
- [ ] **5.3** Versions screen: list (**virtualized** list), filter (release/snapshot), install, play, progress bar. Use only design-system components (item 0.7).
- [ ] **5.4** Real-time game log console.
- [ ] **5.5** Friendly error handling in the UI (network down, disk full, invalid SHA1).
- [ ] **5.6** Final visual identity: logo (lily of light), app icon in every size, and an About screen with version and codename. The palette and tokens have existed since item 0.7.
  - 🛑 Logo and icon direction.

**Done when:** it is possible to install and play a version from the interface alone.

---

## Phase 6. Instances

**Goal:** isolated profiles.

- [ ] **6.1** Instance model (name, version, own folder, min/max RAM, extra JVM arguments, resolution), persisted in versioned JSON.
  - 🛑 Configuration file format and migration strategy.
- [ ] **6.2** Instance CRUD (create, duplicate, rename, delete) in the core + UI.
- [ ] **6.3** Global settings (data folder, Java, download concurrency, theme).
- [ ] **6.4** Open the instance folder in the OS file manager.

---

## Phase 7. Microsoft login

**Goal:** legitimate accounts.

- [ ] **7.1** Register an app in Azure and request approval to access the Minecraft services API. **Worth starting this request early**, in parallel with the previous phases, because it can take a while.
  - 🛑 Everything in this phase: flow (device code recommended), scopes, where to store tokens.
- [ ] **7.2** OAuth device code flow → Xbox Live → XSTS → Minecraft Services → profile (name, UUID, skin).
- [ ] **7.3** Secure token storage with the **OS keyring** (Credential Manager / Secret Service). Never in plain text, never in logs.
- [ ] **7.4** Automatic renewal (refresh token), multiple accounts, logout.
- [ ] **7.5** Check whether the account owns the game, and clear error messages.

### 🏁 Milestone 2: usable launcher with a real account

---

## Phase 8. Mod loaders

- [ ] **8.1** **Fabric** (metadata API): install the loader on an instance.
- [ ] **8.2** **Quilt** (same approach).
- [ ] **8.3** **NeoForge/Forge** (run the installer/processors).
  - 🛑 Whether Forge/NeoForge are in the initial scope or left for later.
- [ ] **8.4** Loader and loader-version selection when creating an instance.

---

## Phase 9. Mods and modpacks

- [ ] **9.1** **Modrinth** API client: search mods, see versions, filter by loader and game version.
- [ ] **9.2** Install/update/remove mods on an instance, with hash verification and dependency resolution.
- [ ] **9.3** Import `.mrpack` modpacks.
- [ ] **9.4** (Optional) CurseForge, which requires an API key and its own terms.
  - 🛑 Compliance with the APIs' terms of use.

---

## Phase 10. Polish and distribution

- [ ] **10.1** Installers: Windows (NSIS/MSI) and Linux (AppImage + deb; Flatpak as a goal).
- [ ] **10.2** Auto-update (Tauri updater) with signing.
  - 🛑 Where to host releases and how to manage the signing key.
- [ ] **10.3** Automated release in CI (tag → build → GitHub Release), with the version codename in the title.
- [ ] **10.4** Telemetry/crash report: **off by default**, or nonexistent.
- [ ] **10.5** README, unofficial-project notice, license, contribution guide.
- [ ] **10.6** Performance review: startup time, idle RAM, download throughput.

### 🏁 Milestone 3: public v1.0

---

## Future ideas (out of the initial scope)

- World backup/restore
- Import instances from other launchers (Prism, MultiMC)
- Skins and cape management
- macOS support
- Plugins/themes
- Favorite servers with status ping

## Standing rules

1. One item = one branch = one small PR.
2. No code outside the item's scope.
3. All core logic has tests; no test depends on the network.
4. Game data comes only from Mojang's servers; never redistribute Minecraft files.
5. Always ask on decisions marked with 🛑.
